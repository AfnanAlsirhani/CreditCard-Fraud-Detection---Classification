### Goal the project:
This project aim is to build machine learning models to classify fraudulent card transactions from a given card transactions data.
This system is useful for both people who use credit cards and banks to keep their customers safe.
### Data:
The dataset [CreditCardFraud] (https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
 contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.where we have 284,807 transactions with 29 features.
### Modeling workflow:
1- EDA, to find anomalies in the data such as duplicates, Nulls and outliers.
</br>
2- Feature engineering to enhance the model.
</br>
3- Data split into training, validation and testing.
</br>
4- Dealing with imalance data by: SMOTE and ADASYN methods.
</br>
5- The following models are used:
</br>
5.1) Logstic regression (Baseline)
</br>
5.2) SVM
</br>
5.3) Random forest
</br>
5.4) XGboost
</br>
5.5) Decision trees
### Finding:

- As seen in above table the best model is : XGBClassifier.

- The four models showen in above gragh is to distinguish between Froud and Valid transactions with the imbalanced classes.
</br> 
### Future Work:
1- Try new models and choose the best F1 score.
</br>
2- use resampling method to deal with imbalance data.
</br>
3- The best model we will improve its performance
